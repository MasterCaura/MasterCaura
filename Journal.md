So, I've started a new journal because I want to keep track of how I'm progressing. I'm confident in my python skills -- well, maybe comfortable calling myself a novice, at least -- but know that I have a lot of room to grow.

08-24-2021: I've started playing a new game called Blades in the Dark. I'm intending to do some RNG based world building so I'm going to write a program to facilitate that. First I'll create a DataFrame to hold the information. Then I'll call the DataFrame and add a row with any relevant information created, then save the DataFrame. Doing it this way allows me to let the parts move mostly on their own while still having an easy way to access it.
