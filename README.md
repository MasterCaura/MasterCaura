Hey there. I'm Aaron. I've been studying python for a while and am looking into learning AWS next.

Here you'll find scraps of code, pet projects, or other things I'm tinkering on. If you want to see my finished portfolio, you can find it at [here].

If you're interested in a collaboration, feel free to message me here or at [thing].
